# CloneCloneClassification
Code Clone Classification based on Multi-Dimension Feature Entropy
## Introduction
Managing code clones remains a critical challenge in software engineering despite advanced detection techniques. While refactoring typically eliminates clones, complex groups with variants across locations complicate this process. Our research analyzes large-scale datasets from three domains, revealing consistent clone metric distributions while demonstrating these alone can't assess refactoring complexity. We introduce a novel entropy-based classification system using four feature entropies—variant, distribution, relation, and syntactic—combined into a fused entropy metric. This approach effectively ranks clone groups by refactorability, helping developers prioritize manageable clones. Validated across multiple domains, our method proves feature entropies significantly identify refactor-friendly clones, with manual analysis confirming complexity isn't solely instance-dependent. This provides new pathways for clone management and future maintenance research.
